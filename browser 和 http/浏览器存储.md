LocalStorage should **be avoided because it is synchronous and will block the main thread**. It is limited to about **5MB** and can contain **only strings**. LocalStorage is not accessible from web workers or service workers.

SessionStorage is tab specific, and scoped to the lifetime of the tab. It may be useful for storing small amounts of session specific information, for example an IndexedDB key. It should be used with caution because it is synchronous and will block the main thread. It is limited to about 5MB and can contain only strings. Because it is tab specific, it is **not accessible from web workers or service workers.**

Cookies have their uses, but **should not be used for storage**. Cookies are **sent with every HTTP request**, so storing anything more than a small amount of data will significantly increase the size of every web request. They are **synchronous**, and are **not accessible from web workers**. Like LocalStorage and SessionStorage, cookies are limited to **only strings**.
